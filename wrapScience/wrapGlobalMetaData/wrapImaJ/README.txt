This directory is a subdirectory of the wrapGlobalMetaData directory
structure for global metadata for the WrapScience Software Platform.
It contains metadata related to Images resources and associated 
processes, which are implemented using the WrapImaJ platform contained
in the WrapScience Platform.

Unless WrapScience has been specifically configured, this
directory, with the name "wrapImaJ", is to be place in
the "wrapGlobalMetaData" directory (see the file README.txt in
the parent directory).
A description of the metadata file format (".wrapMdt" files)
and its usage can also be found in the file README.txt in the
parent directory.
