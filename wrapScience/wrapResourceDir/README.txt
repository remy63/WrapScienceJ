This directory is a subdirectory of the wrapScience directory
structure for data storage of the WrapScience Software Platform.
It contains resources such as Images Buffers, Statistical Samples
and other data sets which are to be processed in the WrapScience
Platform.

This directory must be readable and should be writable by
the user which launches the WrapScience processes, if this
default location is to be used as a filesystem for input and output
data storage for the WrapScience Platform, which is the default
behavior.

If the default location of this directory, which is to be named
wrapResourceDir is not suitable in the user's file system
because the data should be placed elsewhere (e.g. on another
volume or HD partition), for example because of the volume of data,
a symbolic link or shortcut in the filesystem can be used.
